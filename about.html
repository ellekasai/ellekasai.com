<h3>My Story</h3>

<p>I was born in Phillippines and raised in Kanagawa, Japan. After graduating from Gakushuin Women's College with a Marketing degree in 2012, I started working at a payment startup in Tokyo as a sales associate.</p>

<p>But I've always loved to express myself and be creative, and I wasn't quite satisfied with my job. So after a year, I decided to pursue a completely different career in UI design. I left my job, stayed with my <a href="http://chibicode.com/" target="_blank">boyfriend</a> in Silicon Valley, and <a href="https://medium.com/@chibicode/teaching-someone-to-code-is-partly-a-hardware-problem-fe6a2067d770" target="_blank">learned coding and design from him</a>.</p>

<p>Eventually I came back to Japan, and in October 2013, I became a junior designer at <a href="http://www.bizreach.co.jp/" target="_blank">BizReach</a>, a tech startup in Tokyo. I've worked on various projects, including coding the entire frontend of <a href="http://woman.bizreach.jp/" target="_blank">BizReach Woman</a>. During my free time, <a href="/talks">I've taught an online HTML/CSS course and spoke at coding-related events</a>.</p>

<p>When I'm not in front of my computer, I enjoy reading, watching movies, and spending time with my dogs. I was also a model at Ashinari, a Japanese stock photo site. You can view <a href="http://promo.ellekasai.com" target="_blank">my model photos here</a>.</p>

<h3>Moving to Vancouver, Canada</h3>

<p>In October 2014, I left my job in Tokyo and moved to Vancouver, Canada for new challenges. I'm currently looking for a full-time or a  part-time design position.</p>
